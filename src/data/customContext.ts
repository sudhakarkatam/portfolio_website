ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

FAVORITE PROJECT:
My favorite project is currently the Personal Tracker Application. I'm working on more projects and will update them once I complete them or when I have some MVP ready.

AVAILABILITY:
I'm currently available for both freelance and full-time opportunities for the next 2 months. After that, my availability may change as I might get into a job.

UPCOMING PROJECTS:
I'm currently working on a Travel Expense Tracker and have other projects planned, though they're not fully decided yet. I'll update this as I progress with them.

GOALS:
My goal is to build something amazing that satisfies me and learn more technology across all areas. I'm passionate about continuous learning and exploring new technologies.

SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS & WORKSHOPS:
I conducted a 2-day workshop on building AI chatbots using Python at Heartfulness International School. The workshop was delivered to 2 batches of students. I explained how LLMs (Large Language Models) work, and at the end of the workshop, many students built good chatbots. One student even built a chatbot for the school as requested by the faculty. The workshop was very well received, and we received wonderful feedback from both students and faculty.

TECHNOLOGIES I'M LEARNING NEXT:
I'm currently learning various AI technologies including:
- MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- HuggingFace
- Vector databases
- AI agents

If time supports, I'll learn these quickly, otherwise it may take some time, but I'm committed to learning them.

RESUME/CV:
I have a resume available. When users ask for my resume, CV, or curriculum vitae, provide the resume link from the contact information section. The resume link should be formatted as a clickable button like [View Resume](resume_url).
